# Fine-tune LLaMA for Chatbot

## Overview
This project involves fine-tuning the LLaMA language model for chatbot applications. The objective is to adapt the model to generate contextually relevant and engaging responses in a conversational setting. The fine-tuning process utilizes the Unsloth framework for efficient model training and evaluation.

## Features
- **Chatbot Customization:** Tailors the LLaMA model to generate chatbot-specific responses.
- **Fine-Tuning:** Uses Unsloth for efficient and effective model fine-tuning.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Assesses the performance of the fine-tuned model through various metrics.

## Tech Stack
- **Language Model:** LLaMA
- **Fine-Tuning Framework:** Unsloth
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** PyTorch or TensorFlow (depending on Unsloth's requirements)

## Assumptions
- The base LLaMA model and Unsloth framework are compatible and properly configured.
- A dataset of conversational interactions is available for fine-tuning.
- Users have access to appropriate computing resources for model training.
